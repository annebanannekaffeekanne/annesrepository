    <p>After using the algorithm 'gradient descent' we get a prediction for the classes in a testing dataset. First of all
    a better understanding for this algorithm is needed.</p>
    <p>Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function.
        Gradient descent in machine learning is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients)
        that minimize a cost function as far as possible. This so called cost function is in our example the error function.
    which needs to be minimized. After running the algorithm, we can visualize the development of this function.</p>
    <h2>Error Development</h2>

    <p>what we can see is, that the function shrinks over the iterations of the algorithm, which shows that it's working
    properly.</p>
