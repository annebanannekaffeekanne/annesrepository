    <h1>Breast Cancer </h1>
    <h2>Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer caused 670 000 deaths globally in 2022.
    Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age.
    Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in 157 countries out of 185 in 2022.
    Breast cancer occurs in every country in the world.
    Approximately 0.5â€“1% of breast cancers occur in men.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked,
        the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts
        and/or the milk-producing lobules of the breast. The earliest form (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be
        detected in early stages. Cancer cells can spread into nearby breast tissue (invasion). This creates tumours that
        cause lumps or thickening. Invasive cancers can spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs (metastasize).
        Metastasis can be life-threatening and fatal. Treatment is based on the person, the type of cancer and its spread.
        Treatment combines surgery, radiation therapy and medications.

    <h2>Binary diagnostic classificationsystem for breast cancer</h2>
    <p>
    As breast cancer is one of the most common cancers that affects women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB), it
    is important to do checkups. So in case a person has breast cancer they know soon enough to start therapy.</p>
    <p> In order to predict a breast cancer diagnosis we used a machine learning approach to classify data of
    people to make a diagnosis due to given cell-informations such as cell-size, area, concavity,...</p>
